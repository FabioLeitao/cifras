I know it sounds funny but I just can¹t  stand the pain 
Girl, I¹m leaving here to- morrow 
Seems to me, girl, you know I done all I could 
You see I beg, stole and I borrowed 
 
G   D6 Am   Am7/D 
That¹s why I¹m easy 
I¹m easy like Sunday morning 
That¹s why I¹m easy

Why in the world would anybody put  chains on me 
I paid my dues to make it 
Everybody wants me to be what they want me to be 
I¹m not happy when I try to fake it

  I wanna to be high,            so              high 
  I wanna be free to know the things I do are right 
  I wanna be free, just me
