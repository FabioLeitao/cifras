Words like violence
D#m
Break the silence

Come crashing in
Into my little world

Painful to me
D#m
Pierce right through me
G#
Can't you understand
Oh my little girl

All I ever wanted
G#
All I ever needed

Is here in my arms

They can only do harm

So does the pain

Words are meaningless
And forgettable

All I ever needed

They can only do harm
