Verse 1: 
 
	 E 
	Billy Ray was a preacher's son 
	              A                      E 
	And when his daddy would visit he'd come along 
	When they'd gather 'round and started talking 
	B7 
	That's when Billy would take me walking 
	A-through the back yard we'd go walking 
	Then he'd look into my eyes 
	Lord knows to my surprise 

 
	     E 
	The only one who could ever reach me 
	A                   E 
	  Was the son of a preacher man 
	     E 
	The only boy who could ever teach me 
	A                    E 
	  Was the son of a preacher man 
	                B    A

Verse 2 {one line shorter than verse 1}: 
 
	Being good isn't always easy 
	No matter how hard I'd try 
	When he started sweet-talkin' to me 
	He'd come and tell me everything is all right 
	He'd kiss and tell me everything is all right 
	Can I get away again tonight 
 
{repeat Chorus}

	(Yes, he was) 
 
	How well I remember 
	A 
	  The look was in his eyes 
	Stealin' kisses from me on the sly 
	B7 
	   Takin' time to make time 
	Tellin' me that he's all mine 
	E7 
	   Learnin' from each other's knowin' 
	Look at us here, how much we've grown
