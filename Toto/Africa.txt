G#m/F#        A/E             E/F#        E/G#   A9  G#m - C#m
She has only whispers of some quiet conversa - tion
B                Ebm           G#m      G#m/F#
She's coming in twelve thirthy flight   the moolight winds
   A/E                  E/F#              E/G#  A9  G#m - C#m
Reflect the stars that guide me toward salva-tion
B              Ebm             G#m
I stopped an old man along the way
G#m/F#               A/E           E/F#            E/G#   A9 G#m - C#m
Hoping to find some old forgotten words of ancient melo-dies
B              Ebm       G#m                 A9                   G#m - C#m
He turned to me as if to say  hurry boy it's waiting there for you
     F#m           D9             A9       E   E4 E
     Gonna take a lot to drag me away from you
     F#m                     D9            A9             E   E4 E
     There's nothing that a hundred men or more could ever do       
     F#m          D9             A9   E E4 E
     I bless the rains down in   Africa

     Gonna take some time to do the things we never  had

B             Ebm             G#m
The wild dogs cry out in the night
G#m/F#                 A/E        E/F#          E/G#   A9  G#m - C#m
As they grow restless longing for some solitary compa-ny
B           Ebm               G#m
I know that I must do what's right
G#m/F#         A/E               E/F#             E/G#   A9  G#m - C#m
Sure as kilimangiaro rises like olimpus above the serangetti
B         Ebm               G#m
I seek to cure what's deep inside
G#m/F#         A                   A9  G#m - C#m
Frightened of this thing that I've become
     F#m           D9             A9       E   E4 E
     Gonna take a lot to drag me away from you
