(intro) D E C#m

D              E
  Every time I think of you
       C#m                        D
I feel shot right through with a bolt of blue
                                   E
It's no problem of mine but it's a problem I find
C#m                   D
Living a life that I can't leave behind
A                    E
There's no sense in telling me
    C#m                     D
The wisdom of a fool won't set you free

But that's the way that it goes
              E
And it's what nobody knows
      C#m           D
While every day my confusion grows

             E
Every time I see you falling
 C#m               D
I  get down on my knees and pray
                     E
I'm waiting for that final moment
      C#m                   D
You'll  say the words that I can't say

(picking) A E C#m

D              E
I feel fine and I feel good
     C#m            D
I'm feeling like I never should
                                      E
Whenever I get this way, I just don't know what to say
                 C#m                         D
Why can't we be ourselves like we were yesterday
                  E
I'm not sure what this could mean
   C#m                         D
I don't think you're what you seem

I do admit to myself
          E
That if I hurt someone else
          C#m                               D
Then I'll never see just what we're meant to be

D             E
Every time I see you falling
 C#m               D
I  get down on my knees and pray
                     E
I'm waiting for that final moment
      C#m                   D
You'll  say the words that I can't say

D             E
Every time I see you falling
 C#m               D
I  get down on my knees and pray
                     E
I'm waiting for that final moment
      C#m                   D
You'll  say the words that I can't say
