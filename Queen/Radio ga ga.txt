   F
I sit alone and watch your light
   Gm
My only friend through teenage nights
    Bb
And everything I had to know
   Gm            Bb F
I heard it on my radio
     F
You gave them all, those old time stars
         Gm
Through wars of worlds invaded by Mars
     Bb
You made them laugh, you made them cry
     Gm               Bb         F
You made us feel that we could fly  (radio)
    F
So don't become some background noise
  Ab°
A backdrop fot those girls and boys
     Bb
Who just don't know or just don't care
    G/B
And just complain when you're not there

|      F/C
| You had your time, you had your power
|         C
| You've yet to have you finest hour
| Bb F
| Radio (radio)
| F/Eb            Bb   F
| All we hear is radio ga ga
| Bb     F        Bb    F
| Radio goo goo, radio ga ga
| F/Eb            Bb   F
| All we hear is radio ga ga
| Bb      F
| Radio blah blah
| Eb             Bb C
| Radio, what's new?
| Dm      C                   F
| Radio, someone still loves you

    F
We watch the shows and watch the stars
    Gm
On videos for hours and hours
    Bb
We hardly need to use our ears
     Gm               Bb         F
How music's changed through the years
       F
Let's hope you never leave my old friend
     Ab°
Like all the things, on you we depend
    Bb
So stick around 'cause we might miss you
     G/B
When we grow tired of all this visual
