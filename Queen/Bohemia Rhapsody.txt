Mama, just killed a man

put a gun against his head,

pulled my trigger, now he's dead

Mama, Ooooh ...
        Em
didn't mean to make you cry,

if I'm not back again this time

Carry on, carry on

as if nothing really matters.

A
Too late,
   F#m
my time has come
      Bm
Sends shivers down my spine,
                       E
body's achin' all the time,
A
Goodbye everybody,
     F#m
I've got to go,

Gotta leave you all behind and face the truth.
D     Bm
Mama, Ooooh ...

I don't want to die,

I sometimes wish I'd never been
         D
born at all.
