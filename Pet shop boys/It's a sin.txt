  It's always with a sense of shame

  I've always been the one to blame 
Cm         Fm(ii)          Bb 
  For everything I long to do

     It's a sin 
     Fm 
     Everything I've ever done 
     G 
     Everything I ever do 
     Fm 
     Every place I've ever been

     Everywhere I'm going to 
     It's a sin 
 
 
At school they taught me how to be 
So pure in thought and word and deed 
They didn't quite succeed 
For everything I long to do 
No matter when or where or who 
Has one thing in common, too 
 
     It's a, it's a, it's a, it's a sin 
     It's a sin 
     Everything I've ever done 
     Everything I ever do 
     Every place I've ever been 
     Everywhere I'm going to 
     It's a sin

  Father, forgive me, I tried not to do it 
Gbm                      Cm               Bb(?) 
  Turned over a new leaf, then tore right through it 
Cm                       Ebm(i) 
  Whatever you taught me, I didn't believe it 
Gbm                               Ab 
  Father, you fought me, 'cause I didn't care 
        Bb(?)             G(i) 
  And I still don't understand 
 
So I look back upon my life 
Forever with a sense of shame 
I've always been the one to blame 
For everything I long to do 
No matter when or where or who 
Has one thing in common, too 
 
     It's a, it's a, it's a, it's a sin 
     It's a sin 
     Everything I've ever done 
     Everything I ever do 
     Every place I've ever been 
     Everywhere I'm going to - it's a sin 
     It's a, it's a, it's a, it's a sin 
     It's a, it's a, it's a, it's a sin
