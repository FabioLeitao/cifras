How does it feel   when everyone surrounds you? 
D            D9           E    E9   F#m7

lonely?             
D            D9       E                              F#m    A9

How, after a while   you keep falling off the same

mountain. 

 D                 E                                 F#m
Try to explain it, but nothing really gets them that high.

  Steal away in the morning; 
Dm7                  E 
  love's already history to you. 
F                      Am A9 Am

  And tears will dry as you're leaving.

Emotion's a game,   saved up for a rainy Monday. 
D                       D9             E
But you laugh just the same,  'cause it's been

pouring on Sunday. 
D                     E
Call up your numbers, and never let the zeros bring

you down.   
D              D9         E    E9  F#m            A9
  How does it feel?   Is time too heavy to hold?
 
D                 E            F#m         B7
  Whatever you decide for the moment is holy.
