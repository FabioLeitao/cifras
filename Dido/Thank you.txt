(intro) Am   F7M    Am  8x

            F7M                   G         C      G/C   Am
My tea's gone cold, I'm wondering why I got out of bed at all
            F7M                  G           C      G/C#  Am
The morning rain cloud's up my window, and I can't see at all
         F7M              G                     C       G/C#  Am
And even if I could, it'd all be gray, but your picture on my wall
     F7M                Abm/E               F7M
It reminds me that it's not so bad, it's not so bad

Am - F7M -   2X  Am

              F7M                  G                C         G/C#     Am
I drank too much last night, got bills to pay, my head just feels in pain
              F7M                G                C       G/C#   Am
I missed the bus and there'll be hell today, I'm late for work again
         F7M                   G                 C        G/C#     Am
And even if I'm there they'll all imply that I might not last the day
               F7M            Abm/E               F7M
And then you call me and it's not so bad, it's not so bad

    C7M        F7M
And I want to thank you
                   C7M            F7M
For giving me the best day of my life
    C7M         F7M
And oh, just to be with you
              Em              Dm
Is having the best day of my life

Push the door, I'm home at last and I'm soaking through and through
                     F7M                      C7M
Then you handed me a towel and all I see is you
                            F7M                         Em
And even if my house falls down now, I wouldn't have a clue
                Dm
Because you're near me...

    C7M         F7M
And I want to thank you
                   C7M            F7M
For giving me the best day of my life
    C7M         F7M
And oh, just to be with you
              Em              Dm
Is having the best day of my life

For giving me the best day of my life
    C7M         F7M
And oh, just to be with you
              Em              Dm
Is having the best day of my life
