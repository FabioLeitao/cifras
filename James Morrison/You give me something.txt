Intro 2x: G# Fm C

                              G4(7)
You only stay with me in the morning
F                          G7
 You only hold me when I sleep,
Am7                         C
  I was meant to tread the water
F                       G7
  Now I've gotten into deep
Am7                           C
  For every piece of me that wants you
F          D7         G7
  Another piece backs away.

        Em  Am      Dm
'Cause you give me something
      G                  Em
That makes me scared, alright,
      Am          Dm
This could be nothing
         G                     Em
But I'm willing to give it a try,
        Am        Dm
Please give me something
        G                G#  Fm    C
'Cause someday I might know... my heart.

                        G4(7)
You only waited up for hours
F                                        G7
 Just to spend a little time alone with me,
Am7                                    C
 And I can say I've never bought you flowers
F                            G7
 I can't work out what they mean,
Am7                               C
 I never thought that I'd love someone,
F          D7              G
 That was someone else's dream.

Refr√£o.
        Em  Am      Dm
'Cause you give me something
      G                  Em
That makes me scared, alright,

Am          Dm
 This could be nothing
         G                     Em
But I'm willing to give it a try,
        Am        Dm
Please give me something
        G               Eb5(9)    Dm     G7
'Cause someday I might call you from my heart,
        F4(7)      F7         C
But it might be a second too late,
         Eb5(9)              Bb
And the words I could never say
       G7             Em  Am Dm7 G
Gonna come out anyway.

      Em  Am      Dm
'Cause you give me something
      G                  Em
That makes me scared, alright,

Am          Dm
 This could be nothing
         G                     Em
But I'm willing to give it a try,
        Am        Dm
Please give me something
        G               Eb5(9)    Dm     G7
'Cause someday I might call you from my heart.
