(D  Em)
Oh-oh-oh-ohhhhhhhh (x4)
D                                                 Em 
Everybody was Kung Fu fighting, those kids were fast as lightning
                D                                  Em
In fact it was a little bit frightening, but they fought with expert timing

Chorus:
D                             Em      
There were funky China men from funky Chinatown
D                             Em
They were trapping when up, they were trapping when down
D                             Em
It's an ancient Chinese art, and everybody knew their part
D                                  A
For my friend, ain't you a stiff, then I'm kickin' from the hip

D                                                Em
Everybody was Kung Fu fighting, those kids were fast as lightning
                D                                   Em 
In fact it was a little bit frightening, but they fought with expert timing

Chorus:
D                              Em
There was funky Billy Chin and little Sammy Chong
D                              Em
He said, here comes the big boss, let's get it on
  D                                         Em
He took the bow and made a stand, started swaying with the hand
  D                                       A
A sudden motion made me stiff, now we're into a brandnew trip

D                                               Em                                               
Everybody was Kung Fu fighting, those kids were fast as lightning
                D                                        Em               
In fact it was a little bit frightening, but they did it with expert timing

(Bm  Em)
Oh-oh-oh-ohhhhhhhh (x4)

D                                                Em
Everybody was Kung Fu fighting, those kids were fast as lightning
                D                                       Em 
In fact it was a little bit frightening, make sure you have expert timing

D                         Em                       (D  Em)
Kung Fu fighting, had to be fast as lightning...
