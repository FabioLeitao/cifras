    Oh, my love, my darling
          G7                C        Am          G      G7
    I've hungered for your touch, a long lonely time
          C        Am    F          G7             C
    And time goes by, so slowly and time can do so much
        Am         Em     G
    Are you, still mine?
    G7  C            G6  Am7       C
    I   need your love, I need your love
        Dm             G7   C   C7
    God speed your love  to me

    F               G         F           Eb
    Lonely rivers flow to the sea, to the sea
    F              G           C   C7
    To the waiting arms of the sea
    F             G             F            Eb
    Lonely rivers cry, wait for me, wait for me
    F              G              C
    I'll be coming home, wait for me
 
           Am        F            G7                C  
    Oh, my love, my darling, I've hungered for your kiss
      Am          Em      G
    Are you still mine?
    G7 C            G6   Am7       C
    I need your love, I need your love
         Dm             G7   C
    God, speed your love, to me
