I can't stop loving you so I've made up my mind
               D7                         G
To live in memory of old lonesome times
 G7               C                          G
I can't stop wanting you It's useless to say
                 D7                               G  C  G
So I'll just live my life in dreams of yesterday
 D7                 G          G7   C
Those happy hours that we once knew
                       G            A7
Though long a-go still make me blue
 D7                  G       G7         C
They say that time heals a broken heart
                             G      D7         G  C  G
But time has stood still since we've been apart
 G7                 C                           G
I can't stop loving you so I've made up my mind
               D7                         G
To live in memory of old lonesome times
 G7               C                          G
I can't stop wanting you It's useless to say
                 D7                               G  C  G
So I'll just live my life in dreams of yester-day...
