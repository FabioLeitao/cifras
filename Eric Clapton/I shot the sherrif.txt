    All around in my home town they're trying to track me down.

    They say they want to bring me in guilty,  for the killing of a deputy,
                C               D   Em
    for the killing of a deputy. But I say:

    Sheriff John Brown always hated me           for what I don't know.
                C               D        Em                    C          D       Em
    Every time that I plant a seed, he said,  "Kill it before it grow,"
                   C          D        Em
    he said "Kill it before it grow." But I say:

  Em                       Am                                  Em
    I shot the sheriff,       but I swear it was in self-defence, oh yeah!
                              Am                                  Em

    Freedom came my way one day,        and I started out of town.
 C              D                    Em                          C               D           Em
    All of a sudden I see Sheriff John Brown, aiming to shoot me down.
             C         D           Em
    So I shot, I shot him down. But I say:

  Em                      Am                                 Em
    I shot the sheriff,     but I swear it was in self-defence.
                              Am                                Em
    I shot the sheriff,     but I swear it was in self-defence.

    Reflexes got the better of me, and what is to be must be.
 C                          D       Em
     Ev'ry day the bucket goes to the well,
                   C          D                      Em
    but one day the bottom will drop out,
                    C           D                     Em
    yes, one day the bottom will drop out. But I say:
