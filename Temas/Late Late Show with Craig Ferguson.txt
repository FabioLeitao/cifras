 C               C/B            
It's hard to stay up

                      Am
It's been a long long day

                     Am7             Dm
And you've got the Sandman at your door

       Dm(Maj7)
But hang on

            Dm7
Leave the TV on

          G           C
And let's do it anyway



CHORUS:

       D7
It's okay

          F                   G 
You can always sleep through work tomorrow

 C        D7
Okay, Hey hey

F                     Ab     G    C
Tomorrow's just your future yesterday


REPEAT VERSE 2 TIMES & CHORUS 1 TIME


Tell the clock on the wall
Forget the wake-up call
'Cos the night's not nearly through
Wipe the sleep from your eyes
Give yourself a surprise
Let your worries wait another day

And if you stay too late in the bar
At least you made it out this far
So make up your mind and say
Let's do it anyway

CHORUS: Repeat

C     C/B

(Tricky Part)


  E
Life's too short to worry about

      Am
The things that you can live without

 F       
And I regret to say

       C              C/B
The morning light is hours away

 E
The world can be such a fright

 Am
But it belongs to us tonight

 F
What's the point of going to bed?
