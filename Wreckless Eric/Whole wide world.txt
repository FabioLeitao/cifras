When I was a young boy my mama said to me,

"There's only one girl in the world for you,
	E		A
She probably lives in Tahiti."

I'd go the whole wide world,

I'd go the whole wide world just to find her.

Or maybe she's in the Bahamas where the Caribean Sea is blue,
  E			   A			E
Weeping in the tropical moonlit night 'cause nobody's talking about 
 A
you.

 Os acordes da música continuam sempre nas mesmas posições nas frases.Ouvindo a música fica fácil!
 
 Nessa parte não abafe os acordes, apenas dê uma travada impedindo que eles continuem soando (até o refrão).

Why am I hanging around in the rain out here
Trying to pick up a girl
Why are my eyes filling up with these lonely tears
When there're girls all over the world

Is she lying on a tropical beach somewhere
Underneath the tropical sun
Pining away in a heatwave there
Hoping that I won't be long

I should be lying on that sun-soaked beach with her
Caressing her warm brown skin
And then in a year or maybe not quite
We'll be sharing the same next of kin

Refrão:
I'd go the whole wide world
I'd go the whole wide world
Just to find her
I'd go the whole wide world
I'd go the whole wide world
Find out where they hide her
