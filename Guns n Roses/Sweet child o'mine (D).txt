intro: D C G

D
She's got smile that it seems to me
   C
reminds me of childhood memories,
       G                                          D
Where everything was as fresh as the bright blue sky
D
Now and then When I see her face 
     C
she takes me away to that special place, 
           G
and if I stared too long,
                            D
I'd probably break down and cry

 A5          C5                    D5
Woah, woah, woah, sweet child o' mine
 A5           C5                  D5
Woah, oh, oh, oh, sweet love of mine 

D C G

D
She's got eyes of the bluest skies,
   C
as if they thought of rain
   G
I hate to look into those eyes
     D
and see anounce of pain
D
Her hair reminds me of a warm safe place
      C
where as a child I'd hide,
     G
And pray for the thunder and the rain
     D
to quietly pass me by

 A5          C5                    D5
Woah, woah, woah, sweet child o' mine
 A5           C5                  D5
Woah, oh, oh, oh, sweet love o' mine 

D C G

 A5          C5                    D5
Woah, oh, oh, oh, sweet child o' mine
 A5           C5                  D5
Woah, oh, oh, oh, sweet love o' mine 
 A5          C5                    D5
Woah, oh, oh, oh, sweet child o' mine
 A5           C5                  D5
Woah, oh, oh, oh, sweet love o' mine
