(intro 2x)  C D9(11) G Em

           C        D9(11)
I used to rule the world
            G                    Em
Seas would rise when I gave the word
                           C     D9(11)
Now in the morning and I sleep alone
             G              Em
Sweep the streets I used to own

( C D9(11) G Em ) (2x)

           C        D9(11)
I used to roll the dice
          G                 Em
Feel the fear in my enemy's eyes
                C          D9(11)
Listen as the crowd would sing:
         G                  Em
"Now the old king is dead! Long live the king!"

              C        D9(11)
One minute I held the key
          G                    Em
Next the walls were closed on me
                          C        D9(11)
And I discovered that my castles stand
      G                   Em
Upon pillars of salt and pillars of sand

   C              D9(11)
I hear Jerusalem bells are ringing
 G              Em
Roman Cavalry choirs are singing
 C                 D9(11)
Be my mirror, my sword, and shield
    G                 Em
My missionaries in a foreign field
 C                 D9(11)
For some reason I can't explain
G/B                    Em              C      D9(11)
Once you go there was never, never an honest word
           G               Em
That was when I ruled the world

( C D9(11) G Em ) (2x)

                       C    D9(11)
It was the wicked and wild wind
               G              Em
Blew down the doors to let me in.
                           C         D9(11)
Shattered windows and the sound of drums
        G                    Em
People couldn't believe what I'd become

          C      D9(11)
Revolutionaries wait
        G                 Em
For my head on a silver plate
                    C        D9(11)
Just a puppet on a lonely string
     G                        Em
Oh who would ever want to be king?


   C              D9(11)
I hear Jerusalem bells are ringing
 G              Em
Roman Cavalry choirs are singing
 C                 D9(11)
Be my mirror, my sword, and shield
    G                 Em
My missionaries in a foreign field
 C                 D9(11)
For some reason I can't explain
  G                      Em
I know Saint Peter will call my name ,
   C             D9(11)
never an honest word
                  Bm             Em
But that was when I ruled the world
