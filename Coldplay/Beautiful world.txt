Am                  C
Bones, sinking like stones 

            Fmaj7
All that we fall for

Am                 C
Homes places we've grown

              Fmaj7
All of us are done for

Dm                                  Fmaj7                      Dm
   And we live in a beautiful world        (yeah we do yeah we do)

                             Fmaj7
We live in a beautiful world

Am                  C
Bones, sinking like stones

            Fmaj7
All that we fall for

Am                 C
Homes, places we've grown 

              Fmaj7
All of us are done for

Dm                                  Fmaj7                      Dm
And we live in a beautiful world (yeah we do yeah we do)

                             Fmaj7
We live in a beautiful world

(Instrumental)

Am            C                       Fmaj7

Am                   C                      Fmaj7
Cause yeah everybody here got's somebody to lean on
