     G
 It must have been love
          C
 But it's over now

 F        C
 Lay a whisper on my pillow,
           F             G
 leave the winter on the ground
               C                   F
 I wake up lonely, there's air of silence
        Dm               G
 in the bedroom and all around
              Am          C              F
 Touch me now, I close my eyes and dream away

 G                       C
 It must have been love, but its over now
 F                     Dm      Am
 It must have been good, but I lost it somehow
 G                      C
 It must have been love but its over now
 F                 Dm                Am
 from the moment we touched till the time had run out

 G    C
 Make believing, we're together
          F                 G
 that I'm sheltered by hour heart
            C                      F
 But in and outside I've turned to water
            Dm              G
 like a teardrop in your palm
           Am             C             F
 And its hard, winter's day, I dream away

 G                       C
 It must have been love, but its over now
 F                 Dm         Am
 It was all I wanted, now I'm living without
 G                      C
 It must have been love but its over now
 Gm            C                           Bb
 Its where the water flows, its where the wind blows

(solo) Dm C Bb Dm F C Bb Dm C

                   F                 Bb
 It must have been love but its over now
                   Gm          Dm          C
 It must have been good, but I lost it somehow
                   F                  Bb
 It must have been love, but its over now,
                    Gm
 from the moment we touched
          Dm           C
 till the time had run out. Yeah it must have been love...
 Cm                    F                    D#
 It's where the water flows, it's where the wind blows...
