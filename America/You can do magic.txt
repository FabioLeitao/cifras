I never believed in things that I couldn't see
          Bm       Cmaj7        D          Em7
I said if I can't feel it then how can it be
Bm      Cmaj7       D         Em7  Bm
No, no magic could happen to me
           Cmaj7  D
And then I saw you

I couldn't believe it, you took my heart

I couldn't retrieve it, said to myself

What's it all about
C                    D
Now I know there can be no doubt

Doo, doo, doo ...

Em7 Bm        Cmaj7   D         Em7    Bm      Cmaj7
And when the rain is beatin' upon the window pane
D            Em7      Bm       Cmaj7 D            Em7   Bm
And when the night it gets so cold, when I can't sleep
 Cmaj7  D        Em7   Bm
Again   you come to me
Cmaj7      D          Em7       Bm
I hold you tight, the rain disappears
Cmaj7  D       Em7      Bm
Who    would believe it

With a word you dry my tears

  And If I wanted to
Bm7              E
I could never be free
  Am7                   Bm7
I never believed it was true
