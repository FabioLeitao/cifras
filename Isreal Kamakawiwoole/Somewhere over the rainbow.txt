(primeira parte)

 C      Em
Somewhere over the rainbow
F       C
  Way up high
F       C
And the dreams that you dreamed of
G               Am  F
Once in a lullaby

 C      Em
Somewhere over the rainbow
F            C
  Blue birds fly
F       C
And the dreams that you dreamed of
  G                     Am    F
Dreams really do come true..

     C
Someday I'll wish upon a star
 G                                  Am   F
Wake up where the clouds are far behind me
        C
Where trouble melts like lemon drops
 G                               Am          F
High above the chimney tops that's where you'll find me

 C      Em
Somewhere over the rainbow
F            C
  Blue birds fly
F       C
And the dreams that you dare to
     G               Am  F
Oh why, oh why can't I?
