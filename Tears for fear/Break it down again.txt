Verse one:
-------------
C
Break it down again
Am
       So those are my dreams
G
        And these are my eyes
C
        Stand tall like a man
C
        Head strong like a horse
Am7
        When it's all mixed up
C7                                          C
       Better break it down
Am7
       In a world of secrets
C7                                          C
       In a world of sounds

Chorus One:
F/G                                                Gsus4
       It's in the way you're always hiding from the light
Am7                                             G
     See for yourself you have been sitting on a time bomb
F/G                            Gsus4
     No revolution maybe someone somewhere else
Am7                                             G
    Could show you something new about you and your inner song
F/G                                     Gsus4
   And all the love and all the love in the world
Am7                                                C7
    Won't stop the rain from fallling, waste seeping underground

I want to break it down  (break it down again)

Verse two (as verse one):
Break it down again
So those are my schemes
And these are my plans
Hot tips for the boys
Fresh news from the force
When it's all mixed up
Better break it down
In the world of silence
In the world of sound

Chorus two (as chorus one):
-------------------------------------
No sleep for dreaming say the architects of life
Big bouncing babies bread and butter can I have a slice
They make no mention for the beauty of decay
Blue yellow pink umberella save it for a rainy day
And all the love and all the love in the world
Won't stop the rain from falling
Waste seeping underground
I want to break it down (break it down again)

Coda:
------
Am7
Horsing around
D7
Pray to the power
Am7
Play to the crowd with your big hit sound
                Edim
And they won't simmer won't simmer won't simmer down
Am7
Play to the crowd
D7
Play to the crowd
D7
Play

Chorus Three (as chorus one):
------------------------------------
It's in the way you always hiding from the light
Fast off from heaven just like Moses on a motorbike
No revolution maybe someone somewhere else
Could show you something new to help you with the ups and downs
I want to break it down  (break it down again)

Ending:
--------
(No chord)
Break it down again

No more sleepy dreaming
C
No more building up
Fmaj7                   C7            F
      It is time to dissolve
C                                 Fmaj7
Break it down again
C7                               F             C
No more sleepy dreaming
