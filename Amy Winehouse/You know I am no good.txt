Intro: Dm

Dm                          Gm
Meet you downstairs in the bar and heard,
      A7                          Dm
Your rolled up sleeves and your skull t-shirt.
     Dm                         Gm
You say why did you do it with him today? 
      A7                     Dm 
And sniff me out like I was Tanqueray.

Cause you're my fella, my guy 
E7 
Hand me your stella and fly 
F 
By the time I'm out the door, 
E7                     A7
You tear me down like Roger Moore.

Dm                Am 
I cheated myself, 
         E7    Am 
Like I knew I would.				REFRÃO

Dm                     Gm
Upstairs in bed, with my ex boy,
A7                        Dm
He's in the place, but I cant get joy.
Dm                      Gm
Thinking of you in the final throws,
A7               Dm 
This is when my buzzer goes.

Gm 
Run out to meet your chips and bitter, 
E7 
You say when we're married cause you're not bitter 
F 
There'll be none of him no more, 
E7                      A7 
I cried for you on the kitchen floor.
