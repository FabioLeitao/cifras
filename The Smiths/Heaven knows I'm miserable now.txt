      E7M                      C#m
I was happy in the haze of a drunken hour
     F#m                         A        B
But heaven knows I'm miserable now
       E7M                       C#m
I was looking for a job, and then I found a job
     F#m                         A         B
And heaven knows I'm miserable now

In my life
 E7M                         A     B
Why do I give valuable time
    E7M                   C#m          F#m    A      B
 To people who don't care if I live or die?

   E7M                C#m
Two lovers entwined pass me by
     F#m                       A      B
And heaven knows I'm miserable now

         E7M                  C#m
What she asked of me at the end of the day
  F#m                 A      B
Caligula would have blushed
            E7M                      C#m
"Oh, you've been in the house too long" she said
     F#m               A      B
And  I na - turally fled

E7M        A      B
In my life

Why do I smile
    E7M                   C#m              F#m    G#  A#
At people who I'd much rather kick in the  eye?
