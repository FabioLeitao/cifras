I am the son and the heir 
     A               B          F# 
Of a shyness that is criminally vulgar 
I am the son and heir 
                        A B 
Of nothing in particular 

D             A 
You shut your mouth, how can you say 
C#m E                 F# 
I go about things the wrong way ? 
     D                      A 
I am Human and I need to be loved 
C#m       E             :F#:F#:F#:A / B /: 
Just like everybody else does

There's a club if you'd like to go 
               C#m      E          F# 
You could meet somebody who really loves you 
       D 
So you go, and you stand on your own 
A 
And you leave on your own 
        C#m              E 
And you go home, and you cry 
                :F#:F#:F#:A / B /: 
And you want to die 

D                              A 
When you say it's gonna happen "now"
