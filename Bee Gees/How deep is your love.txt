(intro 2x) ( E  E7+  A  A6/B )

(verse 1)
             E          G#m     F#m
I know your eyes in the morning sun
C#7            F#m               G#     A6/B
I feel you touch me in the pouring rain
        E               G#m    C#m
And the moment that you wander far from me
        F#m                  A6/B
I wanna feel you in my arms again

        A                G#m
And you come to me on a summer breeze
        F#m                         D
Keep me warm in your love, then you softly leave
        G#m              A6/B
And it's me you need to show
                  E
How deep is your love

(chorus)
                           E7+
How deep is your love, how deep is your love
A                Am
I really mean to learn
             E                   D                 C#7
'Cause we're living in a world of fools breaking us down
                            F#m
When they all should let us be
     Am              E
We belong to you and me

(verse 2)

E    G#m     F#m
I believe in you
C#7            F#m      G#   A6/B
You know the door to my very soul
             E         G#m      C#m
You're the light in my deepest, darkest night
           F#m          A6/B
You're my savior when I fall

         A              G#m
And you may not think I care for you
          F#m                    D
When you know down inside that I really do
         G#m             A6/B
And it's me you need to show
         E
How deep is your love

(chorus)
                           E7+
How deep is your love, how deep is your love
A                Am
I really mean to learn
             E                   D                 C#7
'Cause we're living in a world of fools breaking us down
                            F#m
When they all should let us be
     Am              E
We belong to you and me
