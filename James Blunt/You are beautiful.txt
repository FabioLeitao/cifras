G
 My life is brilliant
G/F#
 My love is pure
Em7
 I saw an angel
C9
 Of that I'm sure
      G
She smiled at me on the subway
     G/F#
She was with another man
    Em7
But I won't lose no sleep on that

'Cause I've got a plan

C9         D4       G
You're beautiful    You're beautiful
C9             D4          G
You're beautiful,It's True
C9           D4
I saw your face
G        G/F#    Em7
In a crowded    place
   C9           D4        Em7
And I don't know what to do
             C9   D4
'Cause I'll never be with you

( G G/F# Em7 C9 )

         G
Yes, she caught my eye
        G/F#
As we walked on by
          Em7
She could see from my face that I was
C9
 Flying high
    G                       G/F#
And I don't think that I'll see her again
    Em7
But we shared a moment that will last till the end
