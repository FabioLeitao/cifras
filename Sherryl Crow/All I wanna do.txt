Man next to me out of nowhere
Apropos of nothing, he says his name's William

But I'm sure he's Billy, Mac or Buddy
He's plain ugly to me, and I

Wonder if he's ever had a day of fun in his life

We are drinking beer at noon on a Tuesday

In a bar that faces a giant car wash

The good people of the world are washing their cars

On their lunch break, as best as they can in skirts and suits

They drive their shiny Datsuns and Buicks

Back to the phone company and the record store

Until the sun comes up over Santa Monica boulevard

I like a good beer buzz early in the morning
And Billy likes to peel the labels from his bottle of Bud
And shred them on the bar, then he lights every match in an oversized pack
Letting each one burn down to his
Thick fingers before blowing and cursing them out

And he's watching the Buds as they spin on the floor,
A happy couple enters the bar dangerously close,
The bartender looks up from his want ads

Otherwise the bar is ours
The day and thee night and the car wash too
The matches and the Buds and the clean and dirty cars
The sun and the moon
