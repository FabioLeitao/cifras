I... 
G          Bm 
So true, funny how it seems 
C                    Cm                   G 
always in time, but never in line for dreams 
           Bm                C 
head over heels, when toe to toe 
       Em7              C 
this is the sound of my soul 
              G 
this is the sound 
C                          G 
I bought a ticket to the world 
C                        G 
but now I've come back again 
C                           G 
why do I find it hard to write the next line 
         C       Em5+        Am7 
when I want the truth to be said 
G Bm C7+         Bm7 
I...      know this much is true 
G Bm C7+         Bm7     C7+  Am7 
I...      know this much is true 
G                  Bm                     C 
With a thrill in my head an a pill on my tongue 
          Eb                          G 
dissolve the nerves that have just begun 
          Bm7                 C 
listening to Marvin all night long 
       Em7              C 
this is the sound of my soul 
             G 
this is the sound 
C                            G 
always slipping from my hands 
C                      G 
sand's a time of it's own 
C                                       G 
take your seaside arms and write the next line 
     C         Em5+        Am7 
Oh I want the truth to be known 
G Bm C7+        Bm7 
I...      know this much is true 
G Bm C7+         Bm7     C7+  Am7 
I...      know this much is true

This much is true, this much is true...
