E                   A 
There's something happening here 
            E                A 
And what it is ain't exactly clear 
          E                   A 
There's a man with a gun over there 
        E                     A 
Telling me that I've got to beware 
 
Chorus #1: 
                      E                D 
I think it's time we stop, children, what's that sound 
A                   C  (D)  E   E  A  E  A 
Everybody look what goin' down 
  
There's battle lines being drawn 
And nobody's right, if everybody's wrong 
Young people speaking their minds 
Getting so much resistance from behind ...Chorus 
  
Chorus #2: 
              E           D 
It's time we stop, hey, what's that sound 
A                   C  (D)  E   E  A  E  A 
Everybody look what goin' down 
 
 E                       A    A G E 
What a field day for the heat ooooh 
  E                       A      A G E 
A thousand people in the street  ooooh 
         E                   A     A G E 
Singin' songs, and carryin' signs  ooooh 
        E                   A     A G E 
Mostly say "hooray for our side"  ooooh ...Chorus #2 
  
Paranoia strikes deep 
Into your life it will creep 
It starts when you're always afraid 
Step outta line, the men come, and take you away  
Chorus (REPEAT SEVERAL TIMES)
