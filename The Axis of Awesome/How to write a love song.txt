Baby Girl, I wanna show you how much I really love you
           C#m7/B       C#m7/C
How much I really love you
       C#m7               C#m7/A                     C#m7/F#          
Baby Girl, That's what I call you to show you that my love for you is true

C#m7/B  C#m7/C


       C#m7     C#m7/A                  C#m7/F#         C#m7/B     C#m7/C
Baby Girl,    I love you so great that I wrote you this song
        C#m7                      C#m7/A              C#m7/F#  
and to show you how much I really care it sounds like every other one

C#m7/B C#m7/C


C#m7                         C#m7/A                 
The beat kicks in and then I sing a bit more rythmically
 C#m7/F#             C#m7/B       C#m7/C
To make it sensual I sing it in a minor key
C#m7                       C#m7/A  
I move my hands like I'm pushing someone in front of me 
C#m7/F#                        C#m7/B        C#m7/C         A
Now that's the first verse and now I'm gonna take it to the bridge

      Abm                             F#m
I say something bout how I dont wanna break up
       Abm                           A
then i turn around and rhyme it with make up 
  Abm                        F#m
I tell you that we should be together (How Long)
Abm 
Forever (That's Long)
    A                 
and Ever (So Long)
          Abm          F#m
Girl your always in my heart (In my Heart)
      Abm              A
and I never want to be apart (Never be apart)
      Abm              F#m
Honey you'll always be mine (Baby be Mine)
     Abm              F#m
Baby girl it's chorus time

A                        B
This is how you write a love song
     Abm                            F#m
Yeah this is how you write a cliche love song
A                       B
This is how you write a love song

Yeah a shitty 90's R n' B love song

      C#m7              C#m7/A                     
This is my backup and he sings quite breathilly (Breathilly)
  C#m7/F#                    C#m7/B       C#m7/C
He takes the words I sing and sings them after me (Sings em after me)
   C#m7               C#m7/A          
He emphasises words and sings them emphatically (I sing EMPHATICALLY)
C#m7/F#                                     A
Now listen to us singing acapella harmony
Abm                   F#m
 Now were back at the bridge
          Abm                  A
I haven't written anything for this
           Abm         F#m             Abm         A
  So. I'm. gooo honna. streeh heeetch. ooout. the words.
Abm        F#m          Abm         
 repeating everything i say
      A
Til I get (Til I get)
      Abm
Til I get (Til I get)
      F#m
Til I get (Til I get)
      Abm                    F#m
Til I get back to the chorus
A                       B
This is how you write a love song
Abm                                   F#m
Yeah a shitty, shitty, shitty, shitty love song
       A                        B
And to show you I care I throw my hands in the air
                                       C#m          Abm
And cut the music while I sing a long noooooooote

C#m                                                Abm               
Hey girl I've been standing up the back not doing much for this song
                                              C#m 
But that's because my talents are quite limited
                                            Abm                                
But that don't mean that I love you any less

    
In fact it means the opposite (Im just showing off my voice)

C#m         
    It just it's so hard for me to find the words
 
                     Abm    
To really express the way that I feel about you girl

              C#m       
Especially when I have to worry about fitting those words to music 

                             Abm       
And there's some kind of rhyme structure involved (Meaningless Whisper)

C#m       
I know it's lazy song writing but I dont care 
Abm
Cos I sleep on a big pile of money at night
C#m
  girl You might think it's weird girl 
                                     Abm
that three guys are singing about the one girl girl
                                      C#m
But let me tell you something girl it's not weird at all
                                      Abm
In fact girl It's an industry standard
                            
and it happens all the time (Happens all the time)
C#m                                      Abm                          
Well girl I better wrap this up about now cos I just about to cut off by..  

                    F#m
Woahowoahowoahoahoh

A                  B
Baby I wrote you a love song
          Abm                   F#m
It wasn't hard It really didn't take long
 A                B
A totally generic love song
      Abm                       F#m
Yeah really this could be about anyone, but it's for you
 A                B       Abm          F#m
yeah this is a love song, Non-Specific girl
 A                          B
To let you know we take it seriously
     C                      Gm
Then watch as we change the key
         Bb                  C
When you change the key in a love song 
   Am                         Gm
It means your singing passionately
       Bb                        C
but We still haven't reached the end
         C#                    Abm
now were gonna change the key again
F#                        C#
Look at me I'm singing a love song
     Bbm                       Abm
Yeah anyone can sing a shitty love
  F#          C#
Our love is so unique 
      Bbm                F#
That I copied every other shitty love song

Girl
