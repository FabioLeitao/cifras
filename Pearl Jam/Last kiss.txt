	We were out on a date in my daddy's car,
     C                    D
	we hadn't driven very far.
	  G               Em
	There in road, straight ahead,
     C                          D
	a car was stalled and the engine was dead.
        G                      Em
	I couldn't stop so I swerved to the right,
	        C                D
	I'll never forget the sound that night.
               G                 Em
	The screamin' tires, the bustin' glass,
	     C                  D        G
	the painful scream that I heard last.

Hold, G Em C D

	When I woke up the rain was pouring down,
          C                         D
	there were people standing all around.
         G                    Em
	Something warm was running through my eyes,
             C                  D
	And somehow I've found my baby that night.
           G                              Em
	I raised her head, and when she looked at me and said:
          C                      D
	"Hold me darling just a little while!"
           G                            Em
	I held her close, I kissed her our last kiss,
           C                      D
	I found the love that I knew I would miss.
             G                     Em
	But now she's gone, even know I hold her tight,
           C                D          G
	I lost my love, my life, that night.

Hold
