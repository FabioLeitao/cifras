  A            D
I saw from the cathedral
Bm                E
You were watching me
      A            D
And I saw from the cathedral
Bm            E
What I should be
           D
So take my lies
            A
And take my time
               E      D               A
'Cause all the others they wanna take my life
      A              D
And I watch, with an intent, basic
Bm                E
It's the same for you
              A
You hold your hand
         D
And it's all fine - laced and
Bm                     E
would you make me do
           D
So take my lies
            A
And take my time
               E      D               A
'Cause all the others they wanna take my life
E               A
Serious for the winter time
E             A
To wrench my soul
E                  A
Whole cotton whole cotton ears
      D
But I know there must be
       Bm
Yes, I know there must be
       E4                            E
Yes, I know there must be a place to go
        A            D
You saw me, from the cathedral
Bm                   E
Well, I'm an ancient heart
           A             D
Yes, you saw me from the cathedral
Bm                   E
And here we are just falling apart
          D
You catch me
      Bm
I am tired
       E4       E     A  D  Bm  E  A  D  Bm  E
I want all that you are
      A            D
And I saw from the cathedral
Bm               E
You were leaving me
      A            D
And I saw from the cathedral
Bm                   E
Could not see to see
            D
so take my time
            A
and take my lies
               E
'Cause all the others
D               A
They wanna to take my life
