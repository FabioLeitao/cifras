intro) Am Dm G C F B E

       Am
At first I was afraid.
           Dm
I was petrified.
                     G7
I kept thinking I could never live
               C
Without you by my side.
              F
But then I spent so many nights
                  Bb
Just thinking how you'd done me wrong.
          E
I grew strong.
           E7
I learned how to get along.
                Am               Dm
And so you're back from outer space.
          G7
I just walked in to find you here
                C
Without that look upon your face.
                 F
I should have changed my fucking lock.
                Bb
I would have made you leave your key
                E
If I'd have known for just one second
          E7
You'd be back to bother me.

(refr√£o)
        Am
Oh now go.
               Dm
Walk out the door.
                G7
Just turn around now.
                C
You're not welcome anymore.
     F7
Weren't you the one
                Bb
Who tried to break me with desire?
                       E
Did you think I'd crumble?
Did you think I'd lay down and die?
     Am
Oh not I.
            Dm
I will survive.
                  G7
As long as I know how to love
                  C
I know I'll be alive.
            F
I've got all my life to live.
            B
I've got all my love to give.
            E
I will survive.
            E7
I will survive.

      Am
It took all the strength I had
               Dm
Just not to fall apart.
              G7
I'm trying hard to mend
                    C
The pieces of my broken heart.
          F
And I spent oh so many nights
                Bb
Just feeling sorry for myself.
     E
I used to cry.
           E7
But now I hold my head up high.
      Am                         Dm
And you'll see me with somebody new.
                G7
I'm not that stupid little person
           C
Still in love with you.
      F
And so you thought you'd just drop by,
                         Bb
And you expect me to be free.
       E
But now I'm saving all my lovin'
       E7
For someone who's lovin' me.
