Capotraste na 3ª casa		
Am                         Em
   There’s a fire starting in my heart
        G                              Em             G
Reaching a fever pitch, it’s bringing me out the dark
Am                        Em
 Finally, I can see you crystal clear
 G                                 Am               G
Go ahead and sell me out and I'll lay your ship bare
 Am                             Em
See how  I'll leave with every piece of you
 G                        Em                 G
Don’t underestimate the things that I will do
Am                         Em
   There’s a fire starting in my heart
        G                              Em             G
Reaching a fever pitch, it’s bringing me out the dark

  The scars of your love remind me of us
               C11
They keep me thinking that we almost had it all
              G                         Em
The scars of your love, they leave me breathless
              E7
I can’t help feeling

Refrão:
                     Am   G
We could have had it all
                C11
Rolling in the deep
     G              Am      G
You had my heart inside of your hand
           C11
And you played it
        G
To the beat

Am             Em
Baby, I have no story to be told
G                            Em                         G
But I’ve heard one of you and I’m gonna make your head burn
Am             Em
Think of me in the depths of your despair
G                          Em                    G
Making a home down there, as mine sure won't be shared

C11             G                Em
  The scars of your love remind me of us

           C11
And you played it
        G
To the beat  (2x)

Am             Em
Throw your soul through every open door
G                        Em
Count your blessings to find what you look for
G          Am
Turn my sorrow into treasured gold
Em                           G                Am
You pay me back in kind and reap just what you sow

G                   C11
We could have had it all
C11   G              Am     G
We could have had it all
   C11
It all, it all it all

We could have had it all
              C11
Rolling in the deep

You had my heart inside of your hand
        C11
And you played it (3x)
G      Am
To the beat
