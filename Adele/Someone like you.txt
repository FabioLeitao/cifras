Intro:  A  C#m/G#  F#m D

      A              C#m/G#
I've heard that you're settled down
       F#m
That you found a girl
          D
And you're married now

A                      C#m/G#
I've heard that your dreams came true
           F#m
Guess she gave you things
          D
I didn't give to you

A                       C#m/G#
Old friend why are you so shy?
            F#m
Ain't like you to hold back
    D
Or hide from life

   E                           F#m7(11)      D
I hate to turn up out of the blue uninvited but

I couldn't stay away I couldn't fight it
     E
I'd hoped you'd see my face
      F#m7(11)                           D    D9(4+) D
And that you'd be reminded that for me it isn't over

A                  E            F#m  D
  Never mind I'll find someone like you
        A               E        F#m D
I wish nothing but the best for you too
       A           E          F#m        D
Don't forget me I beg I'll remember you said
               A                 E
"Sometimes it lasts in love but sometimes
         F#m      D
it hurts instead"
               A                 E
"Sometimes it lasts in love but sometimes
         F#m      D
it hurts instead"

A                  C#m/G#
 You'd know how time flies
      F#m
Only yesterday
         D
was the time of our lives

         A
We were born and raised
    C#m/G#
In a summer haze
       F#m                     D
Bound by the surprise of our glory days

   E                            F#m7(11)
I hate to turn up out of the blue uninvited but
D
I couldn't stay away I couldn't fight it

Bm7(11)
Nothing compares no worries or cares
F#m7/C#
Regrets and mistakes their memories make
  D5
Who would have known how
         Bm    C#m7(5+)     D
Bitter-sweet this would taste
