(intro) Bb  F  Cm  Gm  F

( Bb  F  Cm  Gm  F )
There was a game we used to play
We would hit the town on Friday night
And stay in bed until Sunday
We used to be so free
We were living for the love we had and
Living not for reality

(chorus)
Just my imagination   (3x)
It was (1x)
Just my imagination   (3x)

( Bb  F  Cm  Gm  F )
There was a time I used to pray
I have always kept my faith in love
It's the greatest thing from the man above
The game I used to play
I've always put my cards upon the table
Let it never be said that I'd be unstable

(chorus)
Just my imagination   (3x)
It was (1x)
Just my imagination   (3x)

( Bb  F  Cm  Gm  F )
There is a game I like to play
I like to hit the town on Friday night
And stay in bed until Sunday
We'll always be this free
We will be living for the love we have
Living not for reality

(chorus)
It's not my imagination (3x)
It was...(1x)
Not my imagination (3x)

( Bb  F  Cm  Gm  F )
Not mine   (16x)
