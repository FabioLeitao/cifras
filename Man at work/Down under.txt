Travelling in a fried-out Kombi
Bm           A              Bm         G  A
On a hippie trail, head full of zombie
Bm           A               Bm      G  A
I met a strange lady, she made me nervous
Bm           A               Bm      G  A
She took me in and gave me breakfast. And she said

D            A                Bm     G  A
Do you come from a land down under
D            A                Bm     G  A
Where women glow and men plunder
D            A                Bm     G  A
Can't you hear, can't you hear the thunder
D            A                Bm     G  A
You better run, you better take cover

Bm           A              Bm   G  A
Buying bread from a man in Brussels
Bm           A              Bm         G  A
He was six foot four and full of muscle
Bm           A              Bm       G  A
I said, "Do you speak-a my language?"
Bm           A              Bm              G  A
He just smiled and gave me a Vegemite sandwich. And he said,

D            A                Bm     G  A
I come from a land down under
D            A                Bm     G  A
Where beer does flow and men chunder
D            A                Bm     G  A
Can't you hear, can't you hear the thunder
D            A                Bm     G  A
You better run, you better take cover.

Bm        A         Bm   G  A
Lying in a den in Bombay
Bm        A           Bm   G  A
Slack jaw, not much to say
Bm           A              Bm         G  A
I said to the man, "Are you trying to tempt me
Bm           A              Bm       G  A
Because I come from the land of plenty.  And he said,

D            A                Bm             G  A
Oh! Do you come from a land down under (oh yeah yeah)
D            A                Bm     G  A
Where women glow and men plunder
D            A                Bm     G  A
Can't you hear, can't you hear the thunder
D            A                Bm     G  A
You better run, you better take cover.
