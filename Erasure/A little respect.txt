I try to discover a little something to make me sweeter. 
             E                    F 
Oh baby refrain from breakin' my heart. 

             C                        G 
I'm so in love with you. I'll be forever blue 
                     F                       Am 
That you gimme no reason why you make-a-me work so hard 
G 
That you gimme no that you gimme no 

that you gimme no that you gimme no 

(Chorus)

               Am              F                      Em  F  G  C 
I hear you calling "Oh baby please, Give a little respect to ...me" 

C                                            G 
And if I should falter would you open your arms out to me? 
                      E                               F 
We can make love not war and live at peace with our hearts 

            C     
I'm so in love with you (in love with you) 
             G 
I'll be forever blue (forever blue) 
                    F                            Am
What religion or reason could drive a man to forsake his lover 
G 
Don't you tell me no don't you tell me no 

don't you tell me no don't you tell me no 

(Chorus)

G 
Don't you tell me no don't you tell me no 

don't you tell me no don't you tell me no
