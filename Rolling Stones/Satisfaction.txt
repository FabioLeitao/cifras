Verso 1:

          E            D A
When Im driving in my car
          E                D A
And that man comes on the radio
          E                   D A
And he's tellin' me more and more
           E             D A
about some useless information
             E            D A
Supposed to fire my imagination

Verso 2: (mesma sequencia de notas do verso 1)

When I'm watching my t.v.
And a man comes on and tells me
How white my shirts could be
Well he cant be a man cos he doesnt smoke
The same cigarettes as me
I cant get no,
no no no.

Verso 3: (mesma sequencia de notas do verso 1 e 2)

When I'm riding 'round the world
And I'm doing this and I'm signing that
And Im trying to meet some girl
And tell me "Baby better come back maybe next week,
Cos you see I'm on a losin' streak"
I cant get no,
no no no.
         E       D A
hey hey hey
