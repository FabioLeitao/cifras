1. She would never say where she came from,
  Am     Am7/G     F              G       
    yesterday don't matter if it's gone,
      Am        D7       G       Am      D7      G
    while the sun is bright, or in the darkest night
     f       c                   G
    no one knows, she comes and goes.

    Good - bye Ruby Tuesday, who could hang a name on you
              G        F               G                      -G
When you change with every new day, still I'm gonna miss you.

2. Don't question why she needs to be so free,
     Am             Am7/G    F             G
   SheÂ´ll tell you it's the only way to be.
      Am       D7        G            Am          D7        G
    She just can't be chained, to a life where nothing`s gained,
        F          C               G
    and nothings lost, at such a cost.   + REFRAIN

3. There's no time to lose I heard her say,
            Am           Am7/G       F          G   
    she'll cash your dreams before they slip away.
      Am    D7      G     Am          D7        G         
    Dying all the time, lose your dreams and you'll 
    F         C                  G
    lose your mind, ain't life unkind.
