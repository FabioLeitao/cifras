    Am    E7      G           Bb     F       F  C  Dm  C
    Angie, Angie, when will those clouds all disappear?
    Am    E7      G             Bb   F       F  C  Dm  C
    Angie, Angie, where will it lead us from here?
            G                          Dm           Am
    With no loving in our souls and no money in our coats,
    C          F             G
    you can't say we're satisfied.
        Am   E7       G         Bb  F        F  C  Dm  C
    But Angie, Angie, you can't say we never tried.

    Am    E7                G             Bb   F       F  C  Dm  C
    Angie, you're beautiful, but ain't it time we said goodbye?
    Am    E7               G          Bb   F              F  C  Dm  C
    Angie, I still love you, remember all those nights we cried?
            G                                 Dm             Am
    All the dreams we held so close seemed to all go up in smoke,
    C      F               G
    let me whisper in your ear,
    Am    E7      G             Bb   F       F  C  Dm  C
    Angie, Angie, where will it lead us from here?

    (Instrumental 1st two lines)

    G                              Dm                 Am
    Angie don't you weep, all your kisses still taste sweet.
    C           F               G
    I hate that sadness in your eyes.
        Am    E7      G        Bb   F           F  C  Dm  C
    But Angie, Angie, ain't it time we said goodbye?

    (Instrumental 1st line)

            G                          Dm           Am
    With no loving in our souls and no money in our coats,
    C          F             G
    you can't say we're satisfied.
        Dm                      Am
    But Angie, I still love you baby.
    Dm                           Am
    Everywhere I look I see your eyes.
    Dm                             Am
    There ain't a woman that comes close to you.
    C       F             G
    Come on baby dry your eyes.
        Am    E7      G        Bb   F      F  C  Dm  C
    But Angie, Angie, ain't it good to be alive?
    Am    E7      G          Bb  F         F  C  Dm  C
    Angie, Angie, they can't say we never tried.
