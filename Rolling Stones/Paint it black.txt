1. (riff 1)   I see a red door and I want it painted black,
                Em                    B7
   (riff 1)   no colors any more I want them to turn black.

    I see the girls walk by dressed in their summer clothes,
     Em D       G      D      A             B7

               Em                      B7
2. (riff 1) I see a line of cars and they're all painted black,
             Em                           B7
   (riff 1) with flowers and my love both never to come back.
    Em   D        G                    Em

    like a new born baby it just happens every day.
            Em                        B7

    Em        D   G     D      A                      B7
