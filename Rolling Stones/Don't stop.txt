INTRO: A D  A  D  A  D

          A
Well you bit my lip and drew first blood
    D
And wore my cold, cold heart
           A
And your wrote your name right on my back
D
Boy your nails were sharp
      A
Don't stop
         D
Honey don't stop
      A
Don't stop
         D
Baby don't stop
      A
Well I love your screams of passion
        D
In the long hot summer night
       A
But you pepper me with poison darts
      D
And twisted in your knife
     A
Don't stop
         D
Honey don't stop
      A
Don't stop
        D
Baby don't stop
          E
Well the only thing I ask of you
       Bm
Is to hand me back some pride
           E
Don't you dump me on some dusty street
     Bm
And hang me out to dry

     A
Don't stop
         D
Honey don't stop
      A
Don't stop
        D
Baby don't stop
Honey

SOLO

    F#m
I'm losing you
                      D
I know your heart is miles away
          F#m                 E                 D
There's a whisper there where once there was a storm
    F#m                                      D
And all that's left is that image that I'll find a way
        E                                 D
And some memories have tattered as they've torn
     A
Don't stop
         D
Honey don't stop
      A
Don't stop
        D
Baby don't stop
Honey!

SOLO

     A
Don't stop

Honey don't stop
      A
Don't stop
        D
Baby don't stop.... A   D      A     D    A     D  --> até o fim
