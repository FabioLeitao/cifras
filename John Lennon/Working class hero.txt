                               Am                          G             Am
                              As soon as you're born they make you feel small 
                                                       G          Am
                              By giving you no time instead of it all
                                                                G         Am
                              Till the pain is so big you feel nothing at all
                               
                                    Am                    G          Am
                                A working class hero is something to be
                                    Am           G        D          Am
                                A working class hero is something to be
                               
                               Am                             G           Am
                              They hurt you at home and they hit you at school
                                                                       G         Am
                              They hate you if you're clever and they despise a fool
                                                                      G            Am
                              Till you're so fucking crazy you can't follow their rules
                               
                                    Am                    G          Am
                                A working class hero is something to be
                                    Am           G        D          Am
                                A working class hero is something to be
                               
                               Am                                       G          Am
                              When they've tortured and scared you for twenty odd years
                                                       G        Am
                              Then they expect you to pick a career
                                                                    G           Am
                              When you can't really function you're so full of fear
                               
                                    Am                    G          Am
                                A working class hero is something to be
                                    Am           G        D          Am
                                A working class hero is something to be
                               
                                        Am                      G       Am
                              Keep you doped with religion and sex and TV
                                                       G          Am
                              And you think you're so clever and classless and free
                                                        G          Am
                              But you're still fucking peasants as far as I can see
                               
                                    Am                    G          Am

                                A working class hero is something to be
                               
                               Am                               G           Am

                              But first you must learn how to smile as you kill
                                                          G            Am
                              If you want to be like the folks on the hill
                               
                                    Am                    G          Am
