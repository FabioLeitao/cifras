From doing what you're supposed to

Rain all day and I don't mind

(terceira parte)

         Am7
But the telephones singin', ringin'
                             D
It's too early don't pick it up

We don't need to we got
Am7
Everything we need right here and
                        D
Everything we need is enough

Just so easy when the
  Bm7
Whole world fits inside of your arms
       Em             Em/D#         C
Do we really need to pay attention to the alarm
          G    D7
Wake up slow, humm...
          G
Wake up slow
     D7
But baby
