(intro) Am   G    F    C

(primeira parte)

     Am
Well I was sitting, waiting, wishing
 G
You believed in superstitions
  F		          C
Then maybe you'd see the signs

     Am
But lord knows that this world is cruel
      G
And I ain't the lord no I'm just a fool
          F	                          C
Learning loving somebody don't make them love you

(refrão)

       E                             Am
Must I always be waiting, waiting on you?
       E                               Am
Must I always be playing, playing your fool?

(segunda parte)

   Am
I sang your songs, I danced your dance
   G
I gave your friends all a chance
 F                                       C
Putting up with them wasn't worth never having you

    Am
Oh maybe you've been through this before
          G
But it's my first time so please ignore
       F	                                C
These next few lines cause they're directed at you

(refrão)

        E                              Am
I can't always be waiting, waiting on you?
        E                                Am
I can't always be playing, playing your fool

(terceira parte)

C 	               E
  I keep playing your part
		  F
But it's not my scene
		    G
Want this plot to twist
	   F          C
I've had enough mystery
		 E
Keep building it up
		             F
But then you're shooting me down
		 G
But I'm already down

               Am
Just wait a minute
G                    F
  Just sitting, waiting
C                Am
  Just wait a minute
G                   F     C
  Just sitting, waiting

(quarta parte)

     Am
Well if I was in your position
     G
I'd put down all my amuntintion
     F	                           C
I'd wonder why it had taken me so long
         Am
But the Lord knows that I'm not you
    G
And if I was I wouldn't be so cruel
       F                                C
Cause waitin' on love ain't so easy to do

(refrão final)

        E                             Am
Must I always be waiting, waiting on you?
       E                                Am
Must I always be playing, playing your fool?
           E                              Am
No I can't always be waiting, waiting on you?
        E                                Am
I can't always be playing, playing your fool
 E            Am
Fool..  uhmm..
