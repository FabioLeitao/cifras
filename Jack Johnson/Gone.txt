Riff 1   ( E        G#       C#m      A)
Well look at all those fancy clothes
but these could keep us warm just like those
and what about your soul? is it cold?
Riff 2   ( F#m                   B)
is it straight from the mold and ready to be sold?

Riff 1   ( E        Gm       C#m      A)
And cars and phones and diamond rings, bling bling 
those are only removable things
and what about your mind does it shine org
Riff 2   ( F#m                   B)
are there things that concern you more than your time  

Riff 3   ( E       B     C#m      A)
gone, going, gone everything gone give a damn
gone be the birds when they don't wanna sing
gone people all awkward with their things, gone.

Riff 1   ( E        G#      C#m      A) 
look at you out to make a deal 
you try to be appealing, but you lose your appeal 
and what about those shoes you're in today 
Riff 2   ( F#m                   B)
they'll do no good on the bridges you've burnt along the way, oh 

Riff 3   ( E       B     C#m      A)
you were willing to sell anything gone with your hurt 
leave your footprints we'll shame them with our words 
gone people all careless and consumed, gone

gone going gone everything gone, give a damn  
gone be the birds when they don't wanna sing 
gone people all awkward with their things gone
