Intro:  ( G  C9  Am7  C  D ) (2x)


G            C9           Am7            C       D         G
  Saying "I love you" is not the word I want to hear from you
                 C9       Am7            C      D      Em
It's not that I want you not to say, but if you only knew
    Am7  D                G      D       Em
How easy it would be to show me how you feel
           Am7
More than words
   D                G7            C
Is all you have to do to make it real
          Cm               G            Em
Then you wouldn't have to say that you love me
      Am7    D      G
Cause I'd already know

                D        Em        Bm       C
What would you do if my heart was torn in two
                             Am7
More than words to show you feel
           D              G
That your love for me is real
                D        Em         Bm     C
What would you say if I took those words away
                               Am7
Than you couldn't make things new
         D             G
Just by saying I love you

 C9             Am7            C      D         G
Da ri da la ri ra ri la la ri la,    more than words
 C9             Am7     D
Da ri da la ri ra


G                 C9      Am7             C       D      G
  Now that I've tried to talk to you and make you understand
         C9             Am7                C          D        Em
All you have to do is close your eyes and just reach out your hands
     Am7       D                   G     D      Em
And touch me, hold me close, don't ever let me go
           Am7
More than words

   D           G7             C
Is all I ever needed you to show
          Cm               G            Em
Then you wouldn't have to say that you love me
      Am7      D             G
Cause I'd   already        know

                D        Em        Bm       C
What would you do if my heart was torn in two
                             Am7
More than words to show you feel
           D              G
That your love for me is real
                D        Em         Bm     C
What would you say if I took those words away
                               Am7
Than you couldn't make things new
         D             G
Just by saying I love you
