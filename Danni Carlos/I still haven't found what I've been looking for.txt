Tom: B
		

 B    Bsus4 (alternando)
 I have climbed the highest mountains
B   Bsus4 (alternando)
I have run through the fields
             E        Esus4           B
Only to be with you, only to be with you

B    Bsus4
I have run I have crawled
B   Bsus4
I have scaled these city walls
            E Esus4       B
These city walls, only to be with you

         F#            E              B
  But I still haven't found what I'm looking for
         F#             E              B
  But I still haven't found what I'm looking for

B  Bsus4
I have kissed honey lips
B Bsus4
Felt the healing in her fingertips
                E                   B
It burned like fire, this burning desire

B  Bsus4
I have spoke with the tongue of angels
B  Bsus4
I have held the hand of a devil
                    E Esus4                 B
It was warm in the night, I was cold as a stone

         F#             E              B
  But I still haven't found what I'm looking for
         F#             E              B
  But I still haven't found what I'm looking for

B Bsus4
I believe in the Kingdom Come
B Bsus4
Then all the colors will bleed into one
           E Esus4               B
Bleed into one, but yes I'm still running.

B Bsus4
You broke the bonds and you loosened the chains
B Bsus4
You carried the cross and my shame
        E Esus4                 B
And my shame, you know I believe it

         F#             E             B
  But I still haven't found what I'm looking for
         F#             E              B
  But I still haven't found what I'm looking for    2x
