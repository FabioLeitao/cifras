Tom: F (Danni Carlos)
		

F                   Dm
I'm not a perfect person
                                    F
There's many things I wish I didn't do
                Dm
But I continue learning
                                    Bb
I never meant to do those things to you
                       C
And so I have to say before I go
                       F
That I just want you to know

                       Dm
I've found a reason for me

                       Bb
To change who I used to be
                        C
A reason to start over new
                 F
And the reason is you

                  Dm
I'm sorry that I hurt you
                                   F
It's something I must live with everyday
                       Dm
And all the pain I put you through
                                 Bb
I wish that I could take it all away
                                     C
And be the one who catches all your tears
                          F
That's why I need you to hear

                        Dm
I've found a reason for me
                        Bb
To change who I used to be
                        C
A reason to start over new
                   Eb
And the reason is you
                  F
And the reason is you
                  Eb
And the reason is you
                  F
And the reason is you

F                   Dm
I'm not a perfect person
                                    Bb
I never meant to do those things to you
                              C
And so I have to say before I go
                        F
That I just want you to know

                        Dm
I've found a reason for me
                        Bb
To change who I used to be
                        C
A reason to start over new
                   F
And the reason is you

                       Dm
I've found a reason to show
                        Bb
A side of me you didn't know
                      C
A reason for all that I do
                 F
And the reason is you
