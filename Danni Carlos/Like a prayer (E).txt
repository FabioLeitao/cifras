Tom: E (Danni Carlos)
		

C#m        B  A   C#m
Life is a mystery
                B   A  C#m
Everyone must stand alone
            B    A  E
I hear you call my name
A       E     B    C#m
And it feels like home
E                 B                        A
When you call my name it's like a litlle prayer
                 E/G#                    E
I'm down on my knees, I wanna take you there
                 B                    A
In the midnight hour I can feel your power
               E/G#                         A
Just like a prayer you know I'll take you there

             E   B              C#m
I hear your voice, it's like an angel sighing
A           E                  B
I have no choice, I hear your voice
A           E
Feels like flying
A          E    B           C#m
I close my eyes, oh God I think I'm falling
A            E             B
Out of the sky, I close my eyes
A            E
Heaven help me

E                 B                        A
When you call my name it's like a litlle prayer
                 E/G#                    E

Just like a prayer you know I'll take you there

         E    B            C#m
Like a child, you whisper softly to me
A              E                 B
You're in control, just like a child
A              E
Now I'm dancing
A           E     B            C#m
It's like a dream, no end and no beginning
A                E                B
You're here with me, it's like a dream
        A
Let the choir sing

C#m                 C#sus
Just like a prayer, your voice can take me there
C#m                     C#sus
Just like a muse to me, you are a mystery
C#m              B/D#           A       E/G#
Just like a dream, you are not what you seem
A                        B
Just like a prayer, no choice your voice can
          C#m
take me there
C#m        B  A       C#m
Life is a mystery
