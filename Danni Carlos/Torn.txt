Tom: E (Danni Carlos) 
		

Intro: E   A   E   F#m

Verse 1:
          E                                      Abm
            I thought I saw a man brought to life
                                                     A
            He was warm, he came around like he was dignified

            He showed me what it was to cry
          E                                       Abm
            Well you couldn't be that man I adored

            You don't seem to know
                                         A
            Don't seem to care what your heart is for

            But I don't know him anymore

Pre Chorus 1:
                         C#m
                 There's nothing where he used to lie
                B
                 My conversation has run dry
               Abm
                 That's what's going on
               B
                 Nothing's fine
                       E
                I'm torn
Chorus 1:
          (E)                    B                C#m
             I'm all out of faith, this is how I feel
                               A                         E
             I'm cold and I am shamed, lying naked on the floor
                               B                      C#m
                Illusion never changed, into something real
                                A                              E
             I'm wide awake and I can see, the perfect sky is torn
                              B                  C#m  (B)  A
             You're a little late, I'm already torn
Verse 2:
          E                                      Abm
            So I guess the fortune teller's right
                                                                A
            I should have seen just what was there and not some holy light
            But you crawl beneath my veins and now

Pre Chorus 2:
                (Same chords and rhythm as Pre Chorus 1)

                 I don't care, I have no luck
                 I don't miss it all that much
                 There's just so many things
                 That I can't touch
                 I'm torn
Chorus 2:
            (Same as Chorus 1)

Bridge:
             C#m  (B)  A       C#m            E         B
           Torn...             Ooooh...  Hoo ooooh...  Ooooh

Pre Chorus 3:
                (Same chords and rhythm as Pre Choruses 1 and 2)

                 There's nothing where he used to lie
                 My inspiration has run dry
                 That's what's going on
                 Nothing's right
                 I'm torn
Chorus 3:
          (E)                    B                C#m
             I'm all out of faith, this is how I feel
                               A                         E
             I'm cold and I am shamed, lying naked on the floor
                               B                      C#m
             Illusion never changed, into something real
                                A                              E
             I'm wide awake and I can see, the perfect sky is torn
                                 B                C#m
             I'm all out of faith, this is how I feel
                               A                              E
             I'm cold and I am shamed, bound and broken on the floor
                              B                  C#m  (B)  A
             You're a little late, I'm already torn
Outro:
          C#m   B
          Torn...  [much wailing]
          Ooh...

Outro/Solo:
              (Same rhythm as Choruses)  [To Fade]
