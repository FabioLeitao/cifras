Tom: G
		
Bm
You and me
   F#m           Em
We used to be together
A7          F#m     Em     A7
Everyday together, always
  Bm       F#m          Em       A7
I really feel that I'm losing my best friend
  F#m                Bm           Em   A7
I can't believe this could be the end
   Bm        F#m       Em         A7
It looks as though you're letting go
D           A
And if it's real
                     B
Well I don't want to know
Em
Don't speak
   Am              D
I know just what you're saying
   B              Am
So please stop explaining
      B                  Em    C  B
Don't tell me 'cause it hurts
Em
Don't speak
  Am               D
I know what you're thinking
  B               Am
I don't need your reasons
      B                 Em    C  D
Don't tell me 'cause it hurts
    Bm
Our memories
F#m            Em
They can be inviting
    A               F#m
But some are all together
           Em       A7
Mighty frightening
Bm               Em          A7
And as we die, both you and I
D               A                   B
With my head in my hands I seat and cry
Don't speak
   Am
I know just what you're saying
   B              Am
So please stop explaining
      B                  Em    C  B
Don't tell me 'cause it hurts
Em
Don't speak
  Am               D
I know what you're thinking
  B               Am
I don't need your reasons
      B                 Em    C  D
Don't tell me 'cause it hurts
C        G/B
It's all ending
        Bb       F/A          G#   C D7/9+ G
I gotta stop pretending who we are
