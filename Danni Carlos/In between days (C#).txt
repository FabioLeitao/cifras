 Db7M       F#
Yesterday I got so old
  Db7M              F#
I felt like I could die
 Db7M       F#
Yesterday I got so old
   Db7M            F#
It made me want to cry
   Db7M 
Go on go on
     F#
Just walk away
   Db7M
Go on go on
      F#
Your choice is made
   Db7M
Go on go on
     F#
And disappear
   Db7M
Go on go on
 F#
Away from here

      Ebm7
And I know I was wrong
       Ab7/4
When I said it was true
        Ebm7                  Ab7/4
That it couldn't be me and be her
                  Db7M  F#
Inbetween without you
        Db7M  F#
Without you      -> 3x

Ebm7    Ab7/4
Aaa...  aaa...   -> 2x

 Db7M       F#
Yesterday I got so scared
   Db7M            F#
I shivered like a child
 Db7M      F#
Yesterday away from you
   Db7M             F#
It froze me deep inside
     Db7M  
Come back come back
      F#
Don't walk away
     Db7M
Come back come back
     F#
Come back today
     Db7M
Come back come back
     F#
Why can't you see?
     Db7M
Come back come back
     F#
Come back to me

      Ebm7    
And I know I was wrong
       Ab7/4
When I said it was true
        Ebm7                  Ab7/4
That it couldn't be me and be her
                   Db7M  F#
In between without you
        Db7M  F#
Without you      -> 3x
        Db7M
Without you
