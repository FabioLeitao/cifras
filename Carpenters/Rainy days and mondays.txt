G            Em7      D      E7
Talking to myself and feeling old;
 Am7                  D    Am7                    D
Sometimes I'd like to quit, nothing ever seems to fit;
 Em7            C7M   Am7         D  D7   G   
Hanging   a  -  round, nothing to do but frown --
Am7                    C             G   D7sus4
Rainy days and Mondays always get me down.
 
G                  Em7     D        E7
What I've got they used to call the blues.
Am7               D      Am7                    D
Nothing is really wrong, feeling like I don't belong,
Em7           C7M    Am7          D      D7 G    
Walking a  -  round, some kind of lone - ly clown --
Am7                    C             G    D   D6
Rainy days and Mondays always get me down.

Nice to know somebody loves  me.
Em7           C7M                 Am7  D7       Em    D    Em7
Funny, but it seems that it's the only thing to do ?
        C7M              D7sus4  D   D7sus4   D
Run and find the one who loves   me.
 
G               Em7      D       E7
What I feel has come and gone before;
Am7                D    Am7                     D
No need to talk it out, we know what it's all about;
Em7             C7M   Am7         D  D7  G    
Hanging   a  -  round, nothing to do but frown --
 Am7                   C             G     D   D6
Rainy days and Mondays always get me down.
