All over the world

You can hear the sound of lovers in love 
      A
You know what I mean

And nobody else in sight

There's nobody else and I'm feeling good

Just holding you tight

The only sound that you will hear 
    G7+           G6                  A
Is when I whisper in your ear I love you 

For ever and ever

There's a kind of hush 
             Bm       D7
All over the world tonight 
              G
All over the world 
                 A               D    A
People just like us are fallin' love
