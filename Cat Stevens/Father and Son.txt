       G                 D                C        Am7
It's not time to make a change, just relax, take it easy
             G                   Em
you're still young, that's your fault,
           Am               D
there's so much you have to know
      G               D           C           Am7
Find a girl, settle down, if you want, you can marry
      G      Em       Am        D
Look at me, I am old, but I'm happy
    G                   Bm             C                Am7
I was once like you are now, and I know that's it's not easy
     G                Em            Am         D
to be calm when you've found something going on
            G             Bm
But take your time, think a lot,
        C                 Am7
think of everything you've got
            G             Em
for you will still be here tomorrow,
        D       G        C
but your dreams may not

       G          Bm
How can I try to explain,
      C            Am7
when I do he turns away again
    G              Em               Am      D
It's always been the same, same old story.
        G              Bm            C            Am7
From the moment I could talk, I was ordered to listen
            G        Em               D        G
now there's a way and I know that I have to go away.
  D     C      G
I know I have to go
