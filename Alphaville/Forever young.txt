Let's dance in style  lets dance for a while

Can you imagine when this race is won

Some are like water  some are like the heat
            C9                     D/F#
Some are a melody and some are the beat
           Em 			 C9
Sooner or later they all will be gone
		      D/F#
why don't they stay young

G	    G/F#		   Em
It's so hard to get old without a cause

I don't want to perish like a fading horse
		Em 	    C9
Youth's like diamonds in the sun
		   D/F#
and diamonds are forever

G	       G/F#		      Em
So many adventures couldn't happen today
	 C9   	            D/F#
So many songs we forgot to play
	  Em			  C9
So many dreams swinging out of the blue
		  D/F#
We let them come true
