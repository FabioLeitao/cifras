F          Em      A7                 Dm       C
Yesterday, all my troubles seemed so far away
Bb      C                       F          Em
Now it looks as though they're here to stay
    Dm    G      Bb     F
Oh, I believe in yesterday
F          Em      A7                 Dm       C
Suddenly, I'm not half the man I used to be
Bb      C                       F       Em
There's a shadow hanging over me
    Dm    G      Bb     F
Oh, yesterday came suddenly

Em   A7  Dm  C Bb  Am       Gm
Why she had to go, I don't know,
    C7        F
She wouldn't say
Em A7   Dm   C    Bb    Am     Gm
I said something wrong, now I long
    C7     F     F7/4 F7
For yesterday-ay-ay-ay
F          Em      A7                 Dm       C
Yesterday, love was such an easy game to play
Bb      C               F          Em
Now I need a place to hide away
    Dm    G      Bb     F F G Bb F
Oh, I believe in yesterday
