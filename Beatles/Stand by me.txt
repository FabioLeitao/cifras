Intro: A F#m D E7 A

A
 When the night has come
F#m
 And the land is dark
              D           E7
 And the moon is the only
                 A
 Light we'll see
 No I won't be afraid
       F#m
 No, I won't be afraid
              D	           E7
 Just as long as you stand
             A
 Stand by me
 And darling, darling stand by me
                    F#m
 Oh, now, now, now,
 Stand by me
D                   E7
 Stand, stand by me
             A
 Stand by me
 If the sky that we look upon
F#m
 Should trumble and fall
     D	                  E7
 And the mountains should crumble
        A
 In the sea
 I won't cry, I won't cry
       F#m
 No, I     won't shed a tear
              D            E7
 Just as long as you stand
             A
 Stand by me
 And darling, darling stand by me
     F#m
 Oh, stand by me
D            E7 A
 Stand by me
