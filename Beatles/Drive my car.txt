D7                     G
Asked a girl what she wanted to be,
D7                         G
She said, baby can't you see?
D7                       G
I wanna be famous, a star of the screen,
     A
But you can do something in between
Bm                     G
Baby you can drive my car
Bm                 G
yes IÂ´m gonna be a star
Bm                     E
Baby you can drive my car
 A     D       G   A
And maybe I'll love you

I told that girl that my prospects were good
And she said baby, it's understood
Working for peanuts is all very fine
But I can show you a better time

I told that girl that I could start right away
And she said listen babe I've got something to say
I got no car and it's breakin' my heart
But I've got a driver and that's a start
