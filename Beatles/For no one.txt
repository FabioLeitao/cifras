  C               Em
Your day breaks, your mind aches
Am            C/G              Fmaj7               Bb
You find that all her words of kindness linger on
               C
When she no longer needs you
  C               Em
She wakes up, she makes up
Am            C/G              Fmaj7               Bb
She takes her time and doesn't feel she has to hurry
          C
She no longer needs you
 
CHORUS:
            Dm             A7
And in her eyes you see nothing
Dm                   A7     Dm
No sign of love behind the tears
            A7
Cried for no one
Dm                       A7     Dm   G11 G7
A love that should have lasted years
 
  C               Em
You want her, you need her
  Am            C/G              Fmaj7               Bb
And yet you don't believe her when she said her love is dead
               C
You think she needs you ...
 
CHORUS
  C               Em
You stay home, she goes out
  Am            C/G              Fmaj7               Bb
She says that long ago she knew someone but now he's gone
               C
She doesn't need him
 
C               Em
Your day breaks, your mind aches
  Am            C/G              Fmaj7               Bb
There will be time when all the things she said will fill your head
               C
you won't forget her ...
