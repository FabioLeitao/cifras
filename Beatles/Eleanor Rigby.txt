Ah! look at all the lonely people.  (2x)

Em
Eleanor Rigby,
                                                   C6
Picks up the rice in a church where a wedding has been,
             Em
Lives in a dream
Waits at the window
                                                 C6
Wearing the face that she keeps in a jar by the door
           Em
Who is it for?

Em7            Em6
All the lonely people
       C                 Em
Where do they all come from?
Em7            Em6
All the lonely people
       C            Em
Where do they all belong?

Father McKenzie
Writing the words of a sermon that no one will hear
No one comes near.
Look at him working,
Darning his socks in the night when there's nobody there
What does he care?

Eleanor Rigby
Died in the church and was buried along with her name
Nobody came
Father McKenzie
Wiping the dirt from his hands as he walks from the grave
No one was saved.
