Help!

A                          C#m
When I was younger so much younger than today
F#m                      D       G   A
I never needed anybody's help in any way
A                                 C#m
But know these days are gone, I’m not so self-assured
F#m                                 D      G      A
Now I find I've changed my mind and opened up the doors

Bm                                    (bass B A G )
Help me if you can, I’m feeling down
      G                               (bass  G  F# E )
And I do appreciate your being'round
E
Help me get my feet back on the ground
          A           A4       A
Won’t you please, please help me?

A                          C#m
And now my life has changed in oh, so many ways
F#m                      D       G   A
My independence seems to vanish in the haze
A                                 C#m
But every now and then I feel so insecure
F#m                                 D      G      A
I know that I just need you like I never done before

Bm                                    (bass B A G )
Help me if you can, I’m feeling down
      G                               (bass  G  F# E )
And I do appreciate your being'round
E
Help me get my feet back on the ground
          A           A4       A
Won’t you please, please help me?
