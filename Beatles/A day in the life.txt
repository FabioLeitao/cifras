(intro) ( G  Bm  Em  C )

G             Bm           Em       Em/D
  I read the news today oh boy,
C          Em           Asus2
  About a lucky man who made the grade.
G                 Bm             Em        Em/D
  And though the news was rather sad,
C              F      Em     Em/D
  Well I just had to laugh,
C            F       Em     C
  I saw the photograph.

G              Bm           Em       Em/D
  He blew his mind out in a car,
C             Em            Asus2
  He didn't notice that the lights had changed,
G             Bm                Em       Em/D
  A crowd of people stood and stared,
C                  F
  They'd seen his face before,
Em                         Em/D                         C
  Nobody was really sure if he was from the House of Lords.

G         Bm           Em      Em/D
 I saw a film today oh boy
C             Em          Asus2
 The English army had just won the war
G            Bm            Em      Em/D
 A crowd of people turned away
C            F
 But I just had to look
Em       Em/D      C
 Having read the book

             D/F#      G   Am  Bm  C  D Em
I'd love to turn     you    on....

( orchestral climax leading to an E chord )

     E                                              D
Woke up, fell out of bed, dragged a comb across my head
          E                   B7
Found my way downstairs and drank a cup
      E              B7
And looking up, I noticed I was late
           E                                                D
Found my coat and grabbed my hat, made the bus in seconds flat
          E                       B7
Found my way upstairs and had a smoke
      E                                B7
And somebody spoke and I went into a dream

 C         G           D      A       E
Aah ah ah ah   Aah ah ah  Ah ah
 C         G           D      A       E       D     C    D     G
Aah ah ah ah   Aah ah ah  Ah ah

G             Bm            Em      Em/D
  I read the news today oh boy,
C                Em                   Asus2
  Four thousand holes in Blackburn, Lancashire.
G                 Bm                Em      Em/D
  And though the holes were rather small,
C              F
  They had to count them all,
Em                                 Em/D                      C
  Now they know how many holes it takes to fill the Albert Hall.

            D/F#       G  Am  Bm  C  D  Em
I'd love to turn     you    on
