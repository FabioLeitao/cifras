John Lennon / Paul McCartney

E           B7
He's a real nowhere man
A              E
Sitting in his nowhere land
F#m            Am                E (seguido do riff)
Making all his nowhere plans for nobody

E               B7
Doesn't have a point of view
A                     E
Knows not where he's going to
F#m        Am                E (seguido do riff)
Isn't he a bit like you and me

        G#m          A
Nowhere man, please listen

        G#m      A                   B7
Nowhere man, the world is at your command

E               B7
He's as blind as he can be
A                  E
Just sees what he wants to see

Leave it all till somebody else lends you a hand
