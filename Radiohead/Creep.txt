                    G
When you were here before,
                         B
Couldn't look you in the eye,
                    C
You're just like an angel
                   Cm
Your skin makes me cry,
                 G
You float like a feather,
               B
In a beautiful world.
                 C
And I wish I was special,
               Cm
You're so fucking special.

           G                B
But I'm a creep, I'm a weird.
                        C
What the hell am I doing here?
              Cm
I don't belong here.

                   G
I don't care if it hurts
                  B
I want to have control,
                 C
I want a perfect body,
                 Cm
I want a perfect soul,
              G
I want you to notice,
             B
When I'm not around,
              C
You're so fucking special,
            Cm
I wish I was special.

     G                B
But I'm a creep, I'm a weird.
                        C
What the hell am I doing here?
              Cm
I don't belong here.

She run run run run runnnnn....

                   G
Whatever makes you happy,
             B
Whatever you want,
              C
You're so fucking special,
            Cm
I wish I was special...

G                B
But I'm a creep, I'm a weird.
