(intro) Am D F G

  Am                   D         F                               G
       Is it getting better,      or do you feel the same ?
Am                      D                             F                                       G
    Will it make it easier on you, now     you’ve got someone to blame ?
                  C                 Am                F                                  C
You said:     one love,        one life,       when it's one need       in the night.
                                 Am           F                                            C
One love, we get to share it, it leaves you baby, if you don't care for it.

( Am D F G )

 Am                    D                F                                                G
    Did I disappoint you,        or leave a bad taste in your mouth?
Am                                     D             F                                               G
    You act like you never had love,        and you want me to go without.
                C                 Am                F                                     C
Well, it's      too late,          tonight,       to drag that past out,        into the light.
                                  Am
We're one, but we're not the same,
               F                               C                        Am      D   F   G
 we get to      carry each other,  carry each other, one.

Am                                           D
Have you come here for forgiveness?
F                                                 G
    Have you come to raise the dead?
Am                                              D         F                                    G
    Have you come here to play Jesus       to the lepers in your head?
           C                       Am
Did I ask too much?              More than a lot ?
F                                               C
    You gave me nothing now,        it's all I got.
                               Am
We're one, but we're not the same,
             F                                         C
well, we hurt each other, and we’re doing it again.

                C                        Am
You said, love is a temple, love the higher law,
C                      Am
love is a temple, love the higher law.

C                                    G
You ask me to enter but then you make me crawl,
                                         F                                                                 C
and I can't be holding on        to what you got, when all you’ve got is hurt.

                  Am                     F                                       C
One love,          one blood,       one life, you’ve got to        do what you should.
                               Am      F            C
One life, with each other, sisters, brothers.
                              Am                                          F
One life, but we're         not the same, we get to        carry each other,
     C
carry each other.
    C      Am    F      C
One,           one.
   C      Am    F      C
One,           one.
