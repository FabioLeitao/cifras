Am  C  Am  E7  Am 
 
                             Am 
Where the road is dark 
                            C 
And  the seat is soaked 
                            Am 
Where the gun is cocked  
                            C 
As the bullet's cold 
                                     Am    G                               Am    G 
Where the miles are marked in the blood and the gold 
               F                     G             Am 
And I'll meet you further on up the road  
 
Am 
Got on my dead man's suit 
                                 C 
And my smilin' skull ring 
                                  Am 
My lucky graveyard boots 
                        C 
And a song to sing 
                          Am  G                                 Am  G 
I got a song to sing,   to keep me out of the cold 
                F                    G             Am	 
And I'll meet you further on up the road  
 
Am                         C 
Further on up the road 
                          Am 
further on up the road 
                              C 
where the way is dark 
                           E7 
and the night is cold 
                            Am     G              Am   G 
but one sunny morning we'll rise, I know 
               F                    G             Am 
and I'll meet you further on up the road

Just  doin' my time 
                                    Am 
Searching through the dust 
                       C 
Looking for a sign 
                               G 
If there's a light up ahead 
                                  Am    G 
Well, buddy, I don't know 
        Am                 
But I got this fever 
G               Am 
Burning in my soul 
                        
                             C 
Further on up the road

Further on up the road

Further on up the road

Further on up the road 
 
 
                          Am  G              Am     G 
One sunny morning we'll rise, I know 
                F                     G             Am     G 
And I'll meet you further on up the road
