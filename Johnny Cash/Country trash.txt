D                          C            G 
I got a crib full of corn, and a turnin' plow 
Dm                     C             G 
But the grounds to wet for the hopper now. 
D                      C     G 
Got a cultivator and a double tree 
Dm                     C        G 
A leather line for the hull and gee 
D                            C        G 
Let the thunder roll and the lighting flash 
Dm                    C       G 
I'm doing alright for Country Trash 
 
 
D                         C     G 
I'm saving up dimes for a rainy day 
Dm                   C    G 
I got about a dollar laid away 
D                                C        G 
The winds from the south and the fishings good 
Dm                            C  G 
Got a pot belly stove a quart of wood 
D                         C    G 
Mama turns the left-overs into hash 
Dm                    C       G 
I'm doing alright for Country Trash 
 
 
D                     C       G 
I got a machina and a hunting dog 
Dm                       C   G 
A cap I ordered from the catolog 
D                            C   G 
A good tall tree that shades the yard 
Dm                     C       G 
A good fat sow for the winters lard 
D                            C        G 
Let the thunder roll and the lighting flash  
Dm                    C       G 
I'm doing alright for Country Trash 
 
 
D                                     C  G 
Well there's not much new ground left to plow  
Dm                 C          G 
And the crops need fertilizer now 
D                          C    G  
My hands don't earn me too much gold  
Dm                  C    G 
For security when I grow old  
D                            C   G 
But we'll all be equal under the grass 
Dm                         C       G  
And God's got a heaven for Country Trash 
 
 
Dm                     C       G 
God's got a heaven for Country Trash  
Dm                        C       G 
I'll be doing alright for Country Trash
