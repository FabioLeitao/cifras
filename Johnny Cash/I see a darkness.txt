Intro: ( Bb   |  F   |  Bb  |  F  )
 
Dm                F
Well, you're my friend.
Bb            F     Bb
And can you see?
Dm                        (smoking)
Many times we've been out drinkin',
                            Bb
Many times we shared our thoughts.
Dm
But did you ever,
                                    C  Bb
Ever notice the kind of thoughts I got?
Am                        Dm 
 Well, you know I have a love,
 
                     Bb
 a love for ev'ry - one I know.
Am                      Dm 
And you know I have a drive
                   C  Bb
to live I won't let go.
 
Dm
Well, can you see its opposition
       Bb
Comes risin' up sometimes,
      Dm
That it's dreadful imposition
                       Bb
Comes blacking in my mind,
 
                  F
And that I see a darkness,
                  Bb
And that I see a darkness,
                  F
And that I see a darkness,
                  Bb
And that I see a darkness?
 
                           F
Did you know how much I love you?
                            Bb
Here's a hope that somehow you
                        F       
 Can save me from this darkness.
 Fsus    F
 
 Dm
Well, I hope that someday buddy,
                           F
We have peace in our lives,
 
Together or apart,
 
 
Dm                    F
Alone or with our wives,
                      Dm
And we can stop our whoring
                            Bb
And pull the smiles in - side
                        F
And light it up for - ever
                   Am
And never go to sleep
                   C
My best unbeaten brother,
                   Am      Bb
This isn't all I seek.
 
                 F
Oh, no, I see a darkness,
                 Bb
Oh, no, I see a darkness,
                 F
Oh, no, I see a darkness,
                 Bb
Oh, no, I see a darkness,
 
                           F
Did you know how much I love you?
                            Bb
Here's a hope that somehow you
                        F
Can save me from this darkness.
