G  G7              C            Cm 
Desperado, why don't you come to your senses 
         G          Em        A7      D7 
You been out ridin' fences for so long now 
             G       G7            C            Cm 
Oh, you're a hard one, I know that you got your reasons,  
      G               Em              A7       D7  G 
These things that are pleasin' you can hurt you somehow 
 
 
          Em                Bm 
Don't you draw the queen of diamonds boy, 
       C                 G 
She'll beat you if she's able, 
             Em                C                G 
You know the queen of hearts is always your best bet 
       Em               Bm                   C              G 
Now it seems to me some fine things have been laid upon your table 
        A7                                  D7 
But you only want the things that you can't get 
 
 
Desperado, oh you ain't gettin' no younger, 
Your pain and your hunger, they're drivin' you home 
And freedom, well, that's just some people talkin' 
Your prison is walkin' through this world all alone 
 
 
Don't your feet get cold in the winter time 
The sky won't snow and the sun won't shine 
It's hard to tell the night time from the day 
You're losin' all your highs and lows 
Ain't it funny how the feelin' goes away 
 
 
Desperado, why don't you come to your senses 
Come down from your fences, open the gate 
It may be rainin', but there's a rainbow above you 
You better let somebody love you, 
You better let somebody love you  
You better let somebody love you before it's too late
