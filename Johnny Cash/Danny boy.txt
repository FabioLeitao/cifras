(intro) C Am F

             G        C          C7                            Dm         F
    Oh Danny Boy, the pipes, the pipes are calling
                           C         Am                          Dm      G
    from glen to glen and down the mountain side.
                              C           C7                Dm         F
    The summer's gone and all the roses falling,
                        C            G                     C
    it's you, it's you must go and I must bide.

        F       G   C                F             G          C
But come ye back, when summer's in the meadow,
         F    G  Am          F                 Em            G      G7
or when the valley' s hushed and white with snow.
                 C      C7     F                       C          F
It's I'll be here        in sunshine or in shadow,
    Dm      C                  Dm     G           C         Am F
o Danny boy, o Danny boy I love you so.

             G         C            C7                          Dm         F
    But when ye come and all the flowers are dying,
                 C           Am                   Dm      G
    if I am dead, as dead I well may be,
                                C          C7                     Dm         F
    You'll come and find the place where I am lying,
                             C         G                     C
    and kneel and say an "Ave" there for me.
