1. Last night I dreamt of San Pedro,
C         Em        G              D
    just like I`d never gone, I knew the song.
        Em              D             Em
    A young girl with eyes like the desert,
C       Em              G              D
    it all seems like yesterday, not far away.
  Em           D              Am              G
Tropical the island breeze, all of nature, wild and free,
  Bm              Am              C    D   Em
this is where I long to be, La Isla Bonita.
               D           Am                G
And when the Samba played,   the sun would set so high,
        Bm                  Am                    C      D    Em
ring through my ears and sting my eyes,  your Spanish lullaby
   Em          D             Em
2. I fell in love with San Pedro, 
C         Em            G              D
    warm wind carried on the sea, he called to me.   
Em         D              Em
   Te    diso     te     amo,  
C       Em              G                     D
    I prayed that the days would last, they went so fast.   + Refrain
   Am          F            G             Am
3. I want to be where the sun warms the sky,
                         F              G             Am
    when it`s time for siesta, you can watch them go by.
               F         G            Am
    Beautiful faces, no care in this world,
                          F         G        B7      Em
    where a girl loves a boy and a boy   -  loves a girl.
    Em              D           Em
4. Last night I dreamt of San Pedro,
C        Em         G              D
    it seems like yesterday, not far away.
