Dm        C  Bb     Dm           C     Bb
Life is a mystery, everyone must stand alone 
Dm         C    Bb F
I hear you call my name 
Bb     F     C    Dm
And it feels like home 

Chorus: 
F                 C                      Bb     
When you call my name it's like a little prayer 
               F                 
I'm down on my knees, I wanna take you there 
F               C                     Bb
In the midnight hour I can feel your power 
             F                             Bb
Just like a prayer you know I'll take you there 
Bb          F     C             Dm
I hear your voice, it's like an angel sighing 
Bb          F                 C       
I have no choice, I hear your voice 
C
Feels like flying 
Bb          F   C                   Dm
I close my eyes, Oh God I think I'm falling 
Bb          F          C
Out of the sky, I close my eyes 
C
Heaven help me 

(chorus) 
Bb      F    C           Dm
Like a child you whisper softly to me 
Bb        F                   C       
You're in control just like a child 
C 
Now I'm dancing 
Bb          F     C           Dm
It's like a dream, no end and no beginning 
Bb          F                   C
You're here with me, it's like a dream 
C
Let the choir sing 

(chorus)+ Dm - C - Dm -- C life is a mistery...  
         oo oo oo oo

Dm                         C
Home, Just like a prayer, your voice can take me there 
Dm                               C
Just like a muse to me, you are a mystery 
Dm                C            Bb             F      
Just like a dream, you are not what you seem 
F    Bb                F                     C
Just like a prayer, no choice your voice can take me there 
F                   C
Just like a prayer, I'll take you there 
Bb                   C  Bb 
It's like a dream to me
