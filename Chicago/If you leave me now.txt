A love like ours is love that's hard to find
G#m7          E       F#    B   Bbm4/7  Eb7
 How could we let it slip away
Em7/9                  Am/E           E
 We've come too far to leave it all behind
G#m7          E      F#       B
 How could we end it all this way
       Ebm7               G#m7
When tomorrow comes we'll both regret
C#m7              Em7/9
Things we said today
