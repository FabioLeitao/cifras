I've been living with a shadow overhead

Bb		              Gm 
There are moments when I don't know if it's real

I need inspiration 
Cm      Bb       F 
Not just another negotiation

And if I open my heart to you

I'm hoping you'll show me what to do 
Cm 
And if you help me to start again

You know that I'll be there for you in the end
